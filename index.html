    <h1>Rohit Kumar Gupta</h1>
    <h3>Front-End Developer</h3>
    <p> I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks like React Js. Over the months, I've worked on a variety of projects, including e-commerce sites, social media platforms, and login pages. I'm passionate about creating user-friendly, responsive, and accessible web experiences that deliver value to users. I'm committed to staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the field. Outside of work, I enjoy doing swimming, football and spending time with my family and friends, and I often use these experiences as inspiration for my design work.</p>

          <h3>Landing Page</h3>
          <p>A landing page is a single webpage specifically designed to prompt visitors to take a certain action, such as filling out a form or making a purchase. It typically features a clear and concise headline, a brief description of the offer, and a prominent call-to-action button. The design is usually minimalist and visually appealing, with an emphasis on the benefits of the product or service being offered. The goal is to capture the visitor's attention and guide them towards conversion.</p>

          <h3>Loading Bar</h3>
          <p>A loading bar project involves creating a visual indicator that communicates the progress of a task or process. It typically consists of a horizontal bar that fills up from left to right as the task completes, and may include a percentage or time remaining display. The loading bar can be implemented in various programming languages using different techniques, such as CSS animations or JavaScript code. The purpose of a loading bar is to provide feedback to the user that the system is working on their request and to reduce uncertainty or anxiety caused by waiting.</p>
        </li>
        <h3>Random Password Generator</h3>
        <p>A random password generator website project involves creating a tool that generates a unique and secure password based on user-specified requirements. The website typically allows the user to select the password length, character types (such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters), and other criteria that influence the generated password. The generated password is usually displayed on the website and can be copied and pasted into the desired application or website. The purpose of a random password generator is to help users create strong, hard-to-guess passwords that can increase the security of their online accounts and protect their sensitive information.</p>
